        <center><p style="color:black">As fellow classmates and business partners coming from the Bicol University, we are eager to showcase the beauty of our local shoe designs. For what we had observed, people in our country prefers to order or shop online for shoes that had been made in foreign countries without realizing that the hand made or even the factory made shoes here in the Philippines are as much durable and great as the ones that other foreign country has to offer.
