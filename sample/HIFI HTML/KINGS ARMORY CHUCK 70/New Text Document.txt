Transforming the best ever into a style icon of the future, the Chuck 70 AT-CX delivers elevation like never before. A cotton canvas upper and tongue get a lift from a chunky CX foam midsole and sockliner for exaggerated comfort. Classic Chuck 70 details like a star ankle patch, aluminum eyelets, and cotton laces keep up the heritage look, while a diamond lugged outsole delivers additional traction.
